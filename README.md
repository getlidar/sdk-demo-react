SDK for use with https://app.refmint.xyz or https://test.refmint.xyz

The Refmint SDK is for developers to be able to make API calls to the Refmint app server and testnet server.
This is an example of a project that uses the logReferral call from the Refmint SDK.

To use the SDK, you must install the Refmint SDK from npm using:

```ts
npm i refmint-sdk
```

As shown in this project, you can then initialize the Refmint Client and call the logReferral function.

Note: You will need a Refmint API Key. Please contact the Refmint team by heading to www.refmint.xyz.
